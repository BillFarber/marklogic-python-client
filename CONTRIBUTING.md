To try this out locally:

- Use Python 3.9 or higher; [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) is recommended for installing and managing Python versions. 
- [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- `python -m venv .venv` to [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
- `source .venv/bin/activate` to use that virtual environment.
- `poetry install` to install project dependencies.

VSCode is recommended for development. You can try [these instructions](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/blog/python-projects-with-poetry-and-vscode-part-1) 
for getting setup in VSCode with linting and formatting enabled.

## Running the tests

Before running any tests, first deploy the test application:

- Use Java 8 or higher
- `cd test-app`
- Create a file named `gradle-local.properties` and add `mlPassword=` to it, with the value of the property being
your admin user's password.
- Verify that the host/port/username in `gradle.properties` work for your MarkLogic installation.
- Run `./gradlew -i mlDeploy`
- `cd ..`

Then run all the tests:

    pytest 

To run an individual test:

    pytest tests/test_search.py

To run an individual test method:

    pytest test/test_search.py::test_search

Note that due to the pytest config in the `pyproject.toml` file, all 
[Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) should appear immediately
as tests are executed.

## Testing the client in a Python shell

After running `poetry install` as described above, you can start a Python shell and manually test the client. You will 
need to launch the shell in the same Python virtual environment as the one in which you ran `poetry install`. After 
ensuring you've done that, start a new Python shell by running `python`. 

You can then import the client via:

    from marklogic import Client

You can instantiate an instance of the client that communicates with this project's test application via:

    client = Client("http://localhost:8030", digest=("python-test-user", "password"))

And you can then start sending requests with the client - for example:

    r = client.get("/v1/search?format=json&pageLength=2")
    r.json()

You can also use the scripts in the `./shell` directory to initialize a client. The following initializes a client
that connects to this project's test application:

    python -i shell/test_app.py

And this initializes a client that connects to the OOTB App-Services app server, which is used for examples in this 
project's documentation:

    python -i shell/docs.py

## Testing the documentation locally

The docs for this project are stored in the `./docs` directory as a set of Markdown files. These are published via
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) using the
configuration found under "Settings / Pages" in this repository. 

You can build and test the docs locally by 
[following these GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll), 
though you don't need to perform all of those steps since some of the files generated by doing so are already in the 
`./docs` directory. You just need to do the following:

1. Install the latest Ruby (rbenv works well for this).
2. Install Jekyll. 
3. Go to the docs directory - `cd ./docs` .
4. Run `bundle install` (this may not be necessary due to Gemfile.lock being in version control).
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You can then go to http://localhost:4000 to view the docs.
