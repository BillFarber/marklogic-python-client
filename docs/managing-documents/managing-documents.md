The [MarkLogic REST documents service](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/client/management) supports
operations that involve writing or reading a single document. It also supports operations that involve multiple 
documents, though those require use of a potentially complex multipart HTTP request or response. The MarkLogic Python
client simplifies those operations by hiding the details of multipart requests and responses.
