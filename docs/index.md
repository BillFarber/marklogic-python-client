The MarkLogic Python Client further simplifies usage of the 
[Python `requests` library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) when developing applications in Python that communicate
with the [MarkLogic REST API](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev). 

See the [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md) to begin using the client.
